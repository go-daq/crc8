# crc8

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-daq/crc8?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-daq/crc8)

`crc8` implements the 8-bit cyclic redundancy check, or CRC-8.
It's entirely copied from Go's standard library `hash/crc32` with obvious edits to change the CRC-32 hash functions into CRC-8.
